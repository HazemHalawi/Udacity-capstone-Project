Project Overview
Social media platforms, online communities sharing knowledge, and many other public websites on Internet have become increasingly known for many problems related to the users’ unethical comments, cyberbullying, etc.
And since manually supervising comments and discussions can be cumbersome regarding the large volume of comments, companies often have to ask employees to take time away from their regular work to sift through comments or taking other measures. This clearly emphasises the need to automate the process of comments classification.
In this project I have trained a machine learning model that is capable of classifying unethical comments using hundreds of thousands of ‘Quora’ labelled comments.
This project is proposed by ‘Quora’ as a ‘Kaggle’ competition.
